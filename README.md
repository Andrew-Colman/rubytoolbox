# The Ruby Toolbox

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox)

As I was focusing on [getting the new site ready for relaunch](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2018-02-01/lets-push-things-forward), development setup documentation got postponed. Pending [#82](https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues/82), development documentation will be added here very soon! Thanks for your patience! All in all, it's a rails app, `bundle`, `rake db:setup` and `bundle exec rspec`, you know the process :)
