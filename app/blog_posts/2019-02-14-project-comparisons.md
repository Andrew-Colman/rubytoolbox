# Project Comparisons

In last November's [community survey][survey] the ability to **compare any selected projects side by side** came in 3rd in the feature requests vote.

Following the **[recent addition of alternate project display modes](/blog/2019-01-31/alternate-project-display-modes)** today I'm happy to introduce a **new [Project Comparison feature](/compare/celluloid,concurrent-ruby,eventmachine)**. It lets you **select any projects** of your choice and **display them side by side** just as in ordinary categories and search results.

**Comparison pages [are linkable](/compare/jekyll,middleman?display=compact&order=rubygem_first_release_on)**, so it's also **easy to share them with others**. Would you like to **reference a set of different libraries for your latest blog post**? Would you like to **keep an ongoing curated list of your favorite gems**? That's very easy now by just **sharing the URL of a comparison page**.

As usual if you'd like to give feedback or have suggestions for improvements on this a great place for that is the [Pull Request of the feature][pr].

Best,<br/>Christoph
