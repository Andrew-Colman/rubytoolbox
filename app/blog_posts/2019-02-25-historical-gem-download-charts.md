# Historical Rubygem Download Charts

Today I'm happy to announce the **[launch of historical Rubygem download charts][PR]**.

On [each](/projects/rake) [Rubygem's](/projects/rspec) [page](/projects/simplecov) you can now find **a chart displaying both the total number of downloads** as well as **the downloads per month**, starting in late 2010.

<a href="https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/428"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13972/53082732-c5b73800-34fd-11e9-8534-b3f116fd2005.png"></a>

The dataset was **reconstructed from Ruby Toolbox backups** as well as the **[Bestgems.org](http://bestgems.org)** API. **Thanks a lot** to the Bestgems creator **[xmisao](https://github.com/xmisao)** for collecting and providing this data!

You can also find **an overview of how the dataset was reconstructed** on our **[corresponding documentation page](/pages/docs/features/historical_rubygem_download_data)**.

As usual if you'd like to give feedback or have suggestions for improvements on this a great place for that is the [Pull Request of the feature][pr].

Best,<br/>Christoph
