# Alternate Project Display Modes

In the [recent community survey][survey] many users requested the ability to **view project data side by side** and **improvements to the way project metrics are presented**.

To that end today I'd like to introduce **two new, alternate project display modes**:

* In the "**Compact**" mode only the **most relevant metrics and links are shown**, **reducing** the need to **scroll and parse heaps of data to get a quick overview**
* In the even more reduced "**Table**" mode the focus is as well on **key metrics**, displayed in a **concise table to enable getting a quick overview faster**

The **Compact mode** is **now the default for category pages on mobile devices** and for **search results on all devices**. Of course you can **switch between the different modes**:

In related news as you can see on the screenshot the **[category bar charts are finally back](https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/401)**. They were a **popular feature of the old site** and were **[often requested to be brought back](https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues/126)** - now they finally are :)

This addition also **sets the stage for another upcoming feature** that was  requested in the [community survey][survey]: **[custom project comparisons](https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/408)**. Those should arrive sometime during the next week.

As usual if you'd like to give feedback or have suggestions for improvements on this a great place for that is the [Pull Request of the feature][pr].

Best,<br/>Christoph
