# Time Flies

[On this day 10 years ago I launched the Ruby Toolbox](https://web.archive.org/web/20091126033506/http://www.ruby-toolbox.com/news/launched_.html). When I built the original site I definetely did not think this funny little idea of mine would still be useful to people ten years later, but here we are :)

Shortly after the release I went to [RailsConf 2009](https://conferences.oreilly.com/rails2009), told people about it and from there on the site [started to gain popularity in the community pretty quickly](https://news.mynavi.jp/article/20090519-a051/).

If you'd like to hear a bit more about the Ruby Toolbox's history I spoke a bit about this with [Brittany Martin](https://twitter.com/brittjmartin) last year during [my appearance on the Ruby on Rails Podcast](http://5by5.tv/rubyonrails/242).

---

I'm very proud I could add a tiny little piece to the wonderful Ruby ecosystem - thanks to all the people I've had the pleasure to meet and talk about the Toolbox (and a million other things) over the years, thanks to everyone making Ruby such a fantastic community to be a part of, and last but not least thanks to [Ruby Together](https://rubytogether.org/) for [their support of my recent work, without which the site would likely not exist anymore](/blog/2018-02-01/lets-push-things-forward)!

Here's to the next 10 years :)

Best,<br/>Christoph
