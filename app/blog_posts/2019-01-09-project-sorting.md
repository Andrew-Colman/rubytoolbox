# Project Sorting

**Happy new year everyone**! I'm back from vacation and going into my second month of working on the Ruby Toolbox backed by [Ruby Together](https://rubytogether.org).

Today I [released][PR] **custom project sorting**, another often-requested feature from the [recent community survey](/blog/2018-12-04/survey-results).

It allows you to **sort project lists** within **categories** and **search results by project metrics** like the date of first release, number of reverse dependencies, recent commit activity and more, which can be helpful to **quickly find projects based on the metrics most relevant to you**:

If you'd like to give feedback on this a great place for that is the [Pull Request][PR] of the feature.

I'll be back soon with more new stuff :)

Best,<br/>Christoph
