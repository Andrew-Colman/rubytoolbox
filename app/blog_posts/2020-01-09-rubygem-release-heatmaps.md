# Rubygem Release History Heatmaps

**Happy new year everyone!**

A [few months ago][PR] I added a heatmap to **illustrate quarterly Rubygem release activity** in a straight-forward manner:

Since the **data still needed to catch up** the feature was not really ready for the official announcement treatment upon release, and afterwards I never quite got around to actually write the post - so here it finally is!

On a side note it's great how CSS grid allows to whip up this kind of layout in a responsive manner in the matter of a few minutes :)

I hope this new feature will **help you in getting a quicker understanding of recent and historical activity on Rubygems** without having to sift through the more detailed data displayed on gems.

Best,<br/>Christoph
