      **Like it's HTML counterpart [project comparisons](/compare) the projects
      API allows to query the data for an arbitrary selection of projects.**

      This allows you to programatically retrieve data for gems and their
      GitHub source repositories in a single place, as well as additional
      metrics specific to the Ruby Toolbox like popularity scores and
      project health status.

      The API has currently no rate-limiting policy, however please use it
      reasonably. If you need larger scale access to data for analysis please
      use our [production database exports](#{page_path("docs/features/production_database_exports")}) instead.

      **A simple ruby API client is available on rubygems as [rubytoolbox-api](/projects/rubytoolbox-api).**
