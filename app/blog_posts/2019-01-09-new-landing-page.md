# New Landing Page

Following shortly after the new [custom project sorting](/blog/2019-01-09/project-sorting) today I'm happy to **introduce a new landing page** that I've been working on.

One huge takeaway from November's [community survey](/blog/2018-12-04/survey-results) was that the Toolbox should **become much more welcoming to new visitors** and **explain it's purpose**.

Previously site visitors were thrown directly to the [categories list](/categories), without any explanations of what this actually is. To that end, the new landing page **gives an overview of what this site is supposed to help you with** and also **provides a list of popular categories** to make it easier to **get familiar with popular tools** of our community without being thrown into the ocean of the full categories list without further assistance.

The **illustration for the new page** is **by [Barbara Đokić](https://www.fiverr.com/barbara_dj)**. I think she did a fantastic job on that, thanks a lot Barbara!

This change is **one step in the ongoing effort** to make the site **friendlier and more accessible**. Another aspect I will be working on in the next weeks are **guides and documentation**.

As usual, if you'd like to give feedback on this a great place for that is the [Pull Request][PR] of the feature. I'm looking forward to hear your thoughts!

Best,<br/>Christoph
